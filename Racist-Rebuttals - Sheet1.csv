All Lives Matter.,All lives cannot matter until black lives matter do.
Black people commit more crime.,"Well, if you have higher police presence in black neighborhoods than white neighborhoods, especially with a corrupt system and arrest quotas, black crimes will be far more documented than white crimes."
More white people are killed by cops than black people.,"There are 6x more whites people in American than black people, so, yes, by sheer numbers they get killed by police more, but black people are shot by cops at a rate 4x higher than white people."
I can’t support rioting and looting.,"If people are arrested and stopped from peacefully protesting, the only options left are to turn violent"
White people have been oppressed too!,"Yes, by other white people"
What about black on black crime?,Black people don’t kill each other because they’re black (also this is only ever brought up to distract from police brutality)
Blue Lives Matter.,"It's not the same. You can stop being a cop, you can’t stop being black. Getting hurt, shot, or killed while on the clock is a occupational hazard. Cops signed up for that, Black people didn’t."
"If they just followed the law, they’d be fine.","Even if they did commit crimes, that doesn’t warrant a death sentence"
Why can’t they just peacefully protest?,"They get shot at, tear gassed, and arrested, or like Kaepernick, they get fired, or worse, like MLK they get assissinated."
